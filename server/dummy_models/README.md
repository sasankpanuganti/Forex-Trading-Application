Dummy Models (placeholders)
===========================

This folder is a placeholder that documents dummy model artifacts for local development and demonstrations.

Purpose

- Provide a single place in the repo describing example model artefacts (Python, Node, TypeScript) without actually including runnable code or wiring them into the application.

Contents (informational only)

- `python_example` — describes a hypothetical FastAPI + scikit-learn model that could be trained and served. Not included in the repo.
- `node_example` — describes a hypothetical Node fallback predictor module. Not included.
- `frontend_example` — describes a small TypeScript predictor that could be used client-side for simple heuristics. Not included.

Usage

- This README intentionally does not provide code or integrations. It is only documentation to indicate where dummy model code would live if you later decide to add examples.
